# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS NOTES.

# Lists

> > > > > Ordered collection of data types also called arrays in other languages.
> > > > > List elements can be accessed by the assigned index. In python starting index of the list, a sequence is 0 and the ending index is (if N elements are there) N-1.
> > > > > We use square brackets[ to create lists].
> > > > > Check code for code examples.

# Tuples

> > > > > Python tuples are similar to lists but Tuples are immutable in nature i.e. once created it cannot be modified. Just like a List, a Tuple can also contain elements of various types meaning their content cannot be changed.
> > > > > We use normal brackets(to create Tuples)
> > > > > Check code for code examples.

# Sets

> > > > > Python set is a mutable collection of data that does not allow any duplication. Sets are basically used to include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. The data structure used in this is Hashing, a popular technique to perform insertion, deletion, and traversal in O(1) on average.
> > > > > If Multiple values are present at the same index position, then the value is appended to that index position, to form a Linked List. In, CPython Sets are implemented using a dictionary with dummy variables, where key beings the members set with greater optimizations to the time complexity.
> > > > > Check code for code examples.

# Frozen Sets

> > > > > Frozen sets in Python are immutable objects that only support methods and operators that produce a result without affecting the frozen set or sets to which they are applied. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.
> > > > > Check code for code examples.

# Dictionaries

> > > > > Python dictionary is an unordered collection of data that stores data in the format of key:value pair. It is like hash tables in any other language with the time complexity of O(1).
> > > > > Indexing of Python Dictionary is done with the help of keys. These are of any hashable type i.e. an object whose can never change like strings, numbers, tuples, etc. We can create a dictionary by using curly braces ({}) or dictionary comprehension.
> > > > > Check code for code examples.

# Matrix

> > > > > A matrix is a 2D array where each element is of strictly the same size.
> > > > > Check code for code example.

# Byte Array

> > > > > Python Bytearray gives a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256.
> > > > > Check code for implementation example

# Linked Lists.

> > > > > A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
> > > > > Check code section for an example implementation
